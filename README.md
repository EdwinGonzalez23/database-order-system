# database_vending_machine_comp
First attempt at a database design for a shipping/ordering company. (Very barebones)

#About Company 
  The fictional company orders products on behalf on clients who own vending machines. The shipping company 
then drives out and stocks the machines. The design process for this database considers two types of employees and the work revolved around 
their job dututies. The two employee types are a delivery driver and a dispatcher.
  Driver: Responsible for picking up orders from a warehouse and deliverying them to vending machines.
  Dispatcher: Repsonsible for placing orders and creating routes for drivers. 
  
 The following ER diagram shows a finialized design for the the database schema:

 The following pdf is a book on the design process of the databse. 
 Chapter 1 - Design requirements, Design Process, Entity/Relationships descriptions, ER diagram
 Chapter 2 - Converting to Relational Model, converting ER Entities/Relationships to Relations(tables), Relations descriptors
            Theory: Relational Algebra/Calculus and Domain Calculus. 10 semi-difficult, non-trivial queries answered in all three. 
 Chapter 3 - Implementation of the Relational Database. Break down of Normalizations.  
 Chapter 4 - Triggers/Stored procedures/Views. Analysis of other database management systems.
 Chapter 5 - Graphical User Interface/Web Application for three main user groups. 
             Client, Driver, Dispatcher
 
The folder database-design contains a PDF technical/analytical/educational report on the design process 
for this database.
